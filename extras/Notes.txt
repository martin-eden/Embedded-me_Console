( void me_Console::Init()

  Why?

  My sketches are plagued with

    #include <me_Uart.h>
    #include <me_Console.h>
    ..
    me_Uart::Init(me_Uart::Speed_115k_Bps)
    Console.Print("Hello there.");

  but they just want to use Console.

  So I've added Init() to replace that "#include" and "me_Uart::Init(..)"
  with "Console.Init()".

  We still respect UART as separate device like printer.
  You can set up UART to 9600 baud or do some other things.
  Console methods are agnostic to this.
